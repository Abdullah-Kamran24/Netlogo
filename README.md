🎮 Tetris Game in NetLogo


👋 Intro

Hello everyone,
My name is Abdullah and today I am presenting a model of the game Tetris, made in NetLogo.

🖥️ NetLogo is a software where we can design simulations — small computer models that copy how things work in the real world.

❓ What is this model?

This is the classic puzzle game Tetris.

🧩 Different pieces, made of 4 small blocks, keep falling from the top.
🎯 Your goal is to make a full horizontal line of blocks.

✨ When a row is complete, it disappears, and the blocks above fall down.
🏆 The more rows you clear together, the more points you score.
⬆️ After clearing enough rows, you move to the next level.
⚡ At higher levels, blocks fall faster, making the game more challenging.

🕹️ How to Use It

SCORE ➝ shows your current points.

LINES ➝ shows how many rows you have cleared.

(Higher level = faster blocks + more points 🎯)

🔷 Things to Notice

There are 7 types of pieces in Tetris:

🟨 Square block (O) – fits well in flat places.

🟧 L-block – good for deep holes.

🟩 S-block – works in uneven areas.

🟪 T-block – average piece, fits in many spots.

🟥 Z-block – like S, but opposite shape.

🟦 Reverse L-block (J) – fits in deep holes.

🟦 I-bar – long piece, only block that can clear 4 rows at once (this is called a Tetris).

🏅 Scoring System

1 Line = 50 × (level + 1) points

2 Lines = 150 × (level + 1) points

3 Lines = 350 × (level + 1) points

4 Lines = 1000 × (level + 1) points (Tetris 🎉)

Clearing the whole board = 2000 × (level + 1) points

Placing each piece = 10 × (level + 1) points


🐢 NetLogo Features

This model uses turtle breeds.
That means we create different types of agents:

one type for falling pieces

another type for placed blocks

🙏 Thank You

That’s all from my side.
Enjoy playing Tetris in NetLogo! 🎮✨
